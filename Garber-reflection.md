What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I maybe needed some work on how to verify that there were no errors prior to pushing to Github

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guide was able to clear up the RESET function.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Did not ask my pair much but the guide was able to answer questions about branches, reset and what to do if an error occurs.

What still confuses you about git?
I don't feel confused about anything in particular.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
The guide was great, the pair left the experience somewhat lacking.  It ended up being a one sided affair that was
all on me to drive.
